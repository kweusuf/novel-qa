# Novel Q&A Assistant

**Novel Q&A Assistant** is a web application that allows users to upload novels in `.txt` and `.epub` formats and ask questions about their content using local LLMs (Large Language Models) via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). The app chunks uploaded novels, stores them in a simple vector database (ChromaDB-like), and uses context retrieval to provide accurate answers.

**üéâ New Feature: EPUB Support!** You can now upload EPUB books directly - the app will automatically extract text content from EPUB files for Q&A processing.

## Features

- üì§ Upload `.txt` and `.epub` novels via web interface
- üìñ **EPUB Processing**: Automatic text extraction from EPUB files using Go's standard library
- üîç Ask questions about uploaded novels (both TXT and EPUB)
- ü§ñ Uses local LLMs (phi3, llama3, mistral, gemma) via Ollama
- üß† Simple context retrieval using keyword search (can be extended to real embeddings)
- ‚ú® **HTML Tag Cleaning**: Removes formatting tags from EPUB content for clean text processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Ollama running locally

### Running Locally

1. **Start Ollama**  
   Make sure Ollama is running on [http://localhost:11434](http://localhost:11434) and has your desired models pulled (e.g., `ollama pull phi3`).

2. **Build and Run the App**
   ```sh
   go build -o novel-qa .
   ./novel-qa
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Usage

1. **Upload a Novel**
   - Use the "Upload New Novel" section to upload `.txt` or `.epub` files
   - The app supports both plain text files and EPUB eBooks
   - EPUB files are automatically processed to extract readable text content

2. **Ask Questions**
   - Enter your question about the uploaded novels
   - Select your preferred AI model (phi3, llama3, mistral, or gemma)
   - The app retrieves relevant context and queries the LLM for an answer

### EPUB Processing Details

When you upload an EPUB file, the app:
- Opens the EPUB as a ZIP archive (EPUBs are ZIP files with a specific structure)
- Extracts HTML/XHTML content files from the EPUB
- Removes HTML tags and formatting to get clean, readable text
- Processes the text into chunks for efficient Q&A
- Stores the processed content in the database for future questions

**Supported EPUB Features:**
- ‚úÖ Standard EPUB 2.0 and 3.0 formats
- ‚úÖ HTML and XHTML content extraction
- ‚úÖ Automatic HTML tag removal
- ‚úÖ Chapter and section preservation
- ‚úÖ Metadata extraction (title, author, etc.)

**Note:** The app uses Go's standard `archive/zip` library, so no external dependencies are required for EPUB processing.
